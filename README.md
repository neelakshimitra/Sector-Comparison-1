# Sector-Comparison-1
This project is a stock return analysis of stocks in three different sectors: technology, energy and finance.

I have decided to evaluate: Nvidia(NVDA), ExxonMobil(XOM) and JPMorgan(JPM).

My goal was to understand return calculation and portfolio performance by first building the logic manually using quantmod in R, and then leveraging Performance Analytics for cleaner risk-return analysis.

## Process and Insights

I used quantmod to retrieve data from NVDA, XOM AND JPM. I noticed they all started trading in 2007 so there was no need to adjust where I started looking at data. I started by exploring the structure of the data, which included Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted.

I decided to delve into data for Close and Adjusted prices. I initially plotted simple plots for adjusted and close prices separately for each stock, I found that the graphs for NVDA close and adjusted prices looked very similar, same for JPM. The only one that showed a stark difference was XOM. 

I then looked at daily arithmetic returns using dailyReturn() on the Adjusted price series. The daily return graphs show how much each stockâ€™s price changed from one trading day to the next.
These plots are visually noisy because returns fluctuate frequently showing a lot of volatility. For more meaningful insights, I calculated cumulative returns to view smoother, long-term trends.
