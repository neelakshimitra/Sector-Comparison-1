# Sector-Comparison-1
This project is a stock return analysis of stocks in three different sectors: technology, energy and finance.

I have decided to evaluate: Nvidia(NVDA), ExxonMobil(XOM) and JPMorgan(JPM).

My goal was to understand return calculation and portfolio performance by first building the logic manually using quantmod in R, and then leveraging Performance Analytics for cleaner risk-return analysis.

## Process and Insights

I used quantmod to retrieve data from NVDA, XOM AND JPM. I noticed they all started trading in 2007 so there was no need to adjust where I started looking at data. I started by exploring the structure of the data, which included Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted.

I decided to delve into data for Close and Adjusted prices. I initially plotted simple plots for adjusted and close prices separately for each stock, I found that the graphs for NVDA close and adjusted prices looked very similar, same for JPM. The only one that showed a stark difference was XOM. 

I then looked at daily arithmetic returns using dailyReturn() on the Adjusted price series. The daily return graphs show how much each stock’s price changed from one trading day to the next.
These plots are visually noisy because returns fluctuate frequently showing a lot of volatility. For more meaningful insights, I calculated cumulative returns to view smoother, long-term trends.

To understand the long-term performance of each stock, I calculated cumulative returns using adjusted closing prices. The y-axis shows how much a £1 investment would have grown over time.

What I found:

NVDA- a £1 investment in 2007 in Nvidia would be worth £250+ by 2025, which is a massive growth, especially relative to the other two stocks. Most of this growth occured post 2016, most likely due to its dominance in AI and GPUs.

XOM- a £1 investment in 2007 in ExxonMobil would be worth around £3 by 2025. XOM showed modest growth, with returns mostly flat from 2007–2020, followed by a sharp rise post-COVID (2021–2022), likely due to energy price surges and inflationary conditions. The energy sector lags behind tech in long-term capital gains.

JPM- a £1 investment in 2007 in JPMorgan would be worth around £9 by 2025.JPM posted consistent gains with some dips (e.g., 2008, 2020), reflecting its resilience as a large-cap financial stock. Its cumulative return sits between the energy and tech sectors, with less volatility than NVDA but more upside than XOM.

### Log Returns

I also calculated log returns for each stock to compare them with arithmetic daily returns. While the graphs appear noisy, they show the day-to-day fluctuations in stock value under a continuous compounding framework — commonly used in financial modeling.

Compared to arithmetic returns, log returns are symmetrical and additive over time, making them useful for statistical analysis. However, like daily returns, they don't reveal long-term trends clearly — which is why I also looked at cumulative returns and performance summaries.


To understand the difference between Close and Adjusted prices and their differing affects on actual return,I calculated and plotted the log returns using both Close and Adjusted prices for each stock.

For XOM and JPM, which are both dividend-paying companies, there was a visible and growing gap between cumulative Close-based returns and Adjusted-based returns. In contrast, NVDA showed almost no difference — which aligns with the fact that it rarely pays dividends and has fewer price-adjusting corporate actions.

I visualised the daily log return differences and their cumulative sum over time to see how the effect builds. This confirmed that for accurate performance analysis — especially over long horizons — Adjusted prices must be used.

### Comparing Log vs Simple Returns

To understand the practical difference between arithmetic (simple) and log returns, I plotted both for each stock.
- The black line shows cumulative returns using compounded arithmetic returns.
- The red line shows cumulative log returns using cumsum().

Across all three plots, the black line is always slightly above the red. This is expected — due to the compounding effect, simple returns tend to slightly overstate growth compared to log returns over long periods.

Notably:
- For NVDA, where returns are massive, the gap between simple and log returns becomes very large (due to compounding over 250x).
- For XOM, where returns are modest, the gap is smaller — but still noticeable over time.
- JPM shows a moderate difference, reflecting steady growth.

This illustrates that while log and simple returns are nearly identical in the short run, they diverge over long horizons — especially for volatile or high-growth stocks. Log returns remain useful for statistical modeling due to their additive property. This matters when presenting performance metrics to clients, writing reports, or comparing investment products — how returns are calculated affects the story.

**When to use which:**
- Use simple returns when reporting portfolio performance to clients or backtesting real investment strategies.
- Use log returns for modeling, regression, volatility estimation, and financial theory.



## Performance Analytics

Each chart includes: Top panel-Cumulative return, Middle panel- Daily returns, Bottom panel- Drawdowns (peak-to-trough loss)

Key insights:
- XOM and JPM show clear divergence between Close and Adjusted returns. The Adjusted returns (pink) are consistently higher, reflecting dividend payouts and other corporate actions. This confirms that Adjusted prices give a more accurate picture of investor returns, especially over long periods.
- NVDA shows minimal difference between Close and Adjusted returns, which is expected for a growth-oriented stock that doesn’t pay regular dividends. This supports the idea that for tech stocks with fewer corporate actions, Close prices may be less misleading — but Adjusted is still safer.
- The drawdown charts show similar patterns for both return types, but because cumulative returns are higher for Adjusted, the impact of drawdowns appears milder when returns are properly adjusted.

### Understanding Drawdowns

The bottom panel of each charts.PerformanceSummary() output visualizes drawdowns— periods where the investment declines from its previous peak. It measures the magnitude and duration of losses, which is a more intuitive and emotionally relevant measure of risk than volatility alone.

For example:
- XOM and JPM, which have steadier growth, show more frequent and longer-lasting drawdowns — especially during events like the 2008 financial crisis and COVID crash.
- NVDA, while highly volatile, shows deep drawdowns but also rapid recoveries due to explosive post-2020 growth.

The Adjusted series typically shows smaller drawdowns than the Close series, because dividends (reflected in Adjusted prices) slightly soften the perceived loss.

This helped me understand that drawdowns show how painful a stock's history might feel to a real investor, and why it’s essential to look beyond return and volatility when evaluating performance.


### Sector Comparison: Tech vs Energy vs Finance-  Close vs Adjusted Comparison

To directly compare the performance of Tech (NVDA), Energy (XOM), and Finance (JPM), I merged the adjusted and close return series for all three stocks and visualized them using charts.PerformanceSummary().

**Chart 1: NDVAvsXOMvsJPM (Close vs Adjusted)**

Key Insights:
- Adjusted returns significantly outperformed Close returns for XOM and JPM, highlighting the impact of dividends and corporate actions.
- NVDA, which rarely pays dividends, showed minimal difference — but the exercise confirms that Adjusted returns provide a more accurate picture of investor gains.
- Volatility and drawdown behavior differed by sector: NVDA had higher spikes and deeper drawdowns but rebounded strongly, while XOM and JPM were more stable.

### Sector Comparison – Adjusted Log Returns

In this plot, I focused only on the Adjusted log return series to ensure a fair comparison of growth and risk between sectors.

- NVDA (Tech) outperformed all others, with exponential growth especially after 2016. Its return curve steepened dramatically post-2020, aligned with the rise of AI and semiconductor demand.
- XOM (Energy) displayed the most muted growth and recovered slowly after crises, reflecting the cyclical nature of the energy sector.
- JPM (Finance) delivered steady, moderate returns with periodic drawdowns during global shocks (e.g., 2008, COVID), but overall resilience.

## Quantitative Summary: Return, Volatility, and Drawdowns

### Annualised Performance Summary

I compared both Close and Adjusted series for completeness, but the Adjusted values are more representative of actual investor experience.

Key Takeaways:
- NVDA had the highest return overall, with 19.30% annually on Adjusted prices — nearly 10x that of JPM and 11x XOM. Despite high volatility (~49.7%), it maintained the strongest Sharpe Ratio (0.2790), reflecting strong returns per unit of risk.
- XOM had a negative return (-1.84%) using Close prices, but this flipped to a positive 1.68% when dividends were included — a clear example of how Close prices can understate actual gains.
- JPM improved from a 2.24% Close-based return to 4.90% Adjusted, but its Sharpe Ratio remained close to zero (0.0037), suggesting limited compensation for volatility.


### Drawdown Analysis

I analysed maximum drawdowns — the percentage drop from a stock’s peak to its lowest point before recovering. These show the depth and duration of losses, which are critical for understanding investor experience during market stress.

Key Takeaways:
- The 2008 crash wiped out nearly 90% of portfolio value, and it took over 8 years (2,038 trading days) to recover — a powerful reminder of the long-term impact of market crashes.
- The 2021–2022 correction also resulted in a sharp 71.87% decline, but this time recovery came much faster (185 days), showing how post-COVID tech strength helped rebound.
- Shorter drawdowns in 2024 reflect more recent volatility, including ongoing dips without full recovery.


## 🧠 Final Reflection

This project helped me bridge theoretical return calculations with practical financial analysis. By manually coding return logic and then validating it using PerformanceAnalytics, I gained a clearer understanding of how different sectors behave, how dividends and splits affect performance, and why risk metrics like drawdowns and Sharpe ratios matter as much as returns. This is one of my first end-to-end financial analytics projects in R, and I'm excited to continue building on this foundation.
