# Sector-Comparison-1
This project is a stock return analysis of stocks in three different sectors: technology, energy and finance.

I have decided to evaluate: Nvidia(NVDA), ExxonMobil(XOM) and JPMorgan(JPM).

My goal was to understand return calculation and portfolio performance by first building the logic manually using quantmod in R, and then leveraging Performance Analytics for cleaner risk-return analysis.
